# COVID-19 INFO BOT

A simple bot with chatterbot and Flask to provide users with information about COVID-19
This bot is trained with information from the WHO Coronavirus FAQ that can be found here: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. The script in scrapper.py connects to the WHO FAQ about COVID-19 and uses Beautiful Soup to scrap the information, formatting it to a YAML file that is then used to train the bot.

Given the need from accurate medical information from a reliable source, this bot will not learn from user responses.It also does not collect any personal information from the user.

This bot is a proof of concept, it is not meant to be used in production. Whatever you do with it, itÂ´s at your own risk.

I used a number of tutorials and resources online:
---> Chatterbot documentation: https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
---> Webscraping tutorial with Beautiful Soup: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/
